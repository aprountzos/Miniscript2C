There is already a Makefile.

1. Type make to produce mycompiler
2. examples-> correct*.ms/.c files in this folder. where * : 1,2,3,4.
3. compiled_examples -> already compiled examples except prime.ms.
Ps. prime.ms executed by mycompiler will give a .c file which won't compile due to: ( arg % arg ) 
    both arguments have to be int format.
